# tree_space_coexistence
Code for spatial recruitment of seedlings and assessment of spatiotemporal coexistence mechanisms.
This code is under construction! 
The goal is to put together code to analyze spatial coexistence mechanisms in data from the Center for Tropical Forest Studies long term monitoring network. In principal, the code should be robust enough to apply to any data set with some minor modifications.
